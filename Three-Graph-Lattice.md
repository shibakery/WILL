# Three-Graph Lattice

## Overview

The Three-Graph Lattice is a foundational architecture that enables WILL to process and validate network events through three interconnected perspectives: Technical, Economic, and Quality.

## Core Components

### 1. Technical Graph (LEGEND)
```yaml
Purpose:
  - Pattern validation
  - Event processing
  - State tracking

Features:
  - Event correlation
  - Pattern matching
  - State management
```

### 2. Economic Graph (NATURAL)
```yaml
Purpose:
  - Value assessment
  - Flow optimization
  - Network effects

Features:
  - Value tracking
  - Flow analysis
  - Network metrics
```

### 3. Quality Graph (INTELLIGENCE)
```yaml
Purpose:
  - Truth validation
  - Pattern recognition
  - Learning systems

Features:
  - Quality assessment
  - Pattern detection
  - System learning
```

## Integration

### 1. Graph Interaction
```yaml
Flow:
  Technical → Economic:
    - Pattern validation
    - Event correlation
    
  Economic → Quality:
    - Value assessment
    - Flow optimization
    
  Quality → Technical:
    - Truth validation
    - Pattern recognition
```

### 2. Network Effects
```yaml
Benefits:
  - Enhanced validation
  - Optimized flows
  - Quality metrics
  - Pattern learning
```

## Development

### 1. Integration Points
```yaml
Public APIs:
  - Event submission
  - Pattern queries
  - Value tracking
  - Quality metrics
```

### 2. Extensions
```yaml
Modules:
  - Pattern analyzers
  - Flow optimizers
  - Quality assessors
  - Network plugins
```

## Community

### 1. Participation
```yaml
Roles:
  - Pattern creation
  - Value assessment
  - Quality validation
  - Network growth
```

### 2. Development
```yaml
Areas:
  - Pattern design
  - Flow analysis
  - Quality metrics
  - Network tools
```

This architecture enables robust validation while maintaining system integrity through the interaction of three specialized graph perspectives.
