# SKENAI Token System

## Overview

The SKENAI ecosystem utilizes a strategic token deployment system that integrates with GFORCE (Governance Framework for Organizational Research and Collaborative Engagement) and WILL. This document outlines the token system, XP earning mechanics, and research proposal methodology.

## Token System Architecture

### Core Tokens

1. **SHIBAK (Platform Token)**
   - Supply: 100 quadrillion
   - Purpose: Core ecosystem value
   - Features: Pattern rewards, value creation
   - Status: Deployed May 2021 (Fully diluted supply)

2. **SBX (Governance Token)**
   - Supply: 25 million
   - Purpose: Governance and staking
   - Features: Voting, validation
   - Status: Development Q1 2025

3. **BSTBL (Stablecoin)**
   - Supply: Algorithmic
   - Purpose: Value stability
   - Features: Price stability, operations
   - Status: Development Q1 2025

4. **SBV (Value Token)**
   - Supply: Dynamic
   - Purpose: Value capture
   - Features: Economic stabilization
   - Status: Development Q1 2025

5. **EVS (Everstrike Token)**
   - Supply: Performance-based
   - Purpose: Technical rewards
   - Features: Development incentives
   - Status: Development Q1 2025

### Token Mechanics

1. **Value Creation**
   - Pattern recognition and rewards
   - Network effects and scaling
   - System evolution mechanics
   - Trade finance integration

2. **Governance**
   - Pattern-based proposal system
   - Value-weighted voting
   - Guardian network oversight
   - Project approval rights

3. **Pattern Integration**
   - Temporal pattern rewards
   - Value preservation incentives
   - Cross-chain pattern detection
   - Trade finance optimization

### Economic Model

```yaml

    - Value preservation bonuses
    - Trade finance premiums
    
  Network Effects:
    - Pattern network growth
    - Guardian participation
    - Cross-chain expansion
    - Market penetration
    
  System Evolution:
    - Pattern complexity scaling
    - Value preservation metrics
    - Network maturity rewards
    - Trade finance integration
```

## XP System Integration

### Objectives
- Increase participation in the SKENAI ecosystem
- Recognize community contributions
- Support William's development and testing

### Components
1. **XP Tracking**
   - Monitor community contributions
   - Track engagement metrics
   - Reward system integration

2. **Incentive Structure**
   - Token distribution based on XP
   - Activity-based rewards
   - Contribution recognition

### Reporting Structure
- Daily XP distribution tracking
- Weekly contribution reviews
- Monthly system effectiveness evaluation

## Research Proposal Framework

- `R` - Research Track (Investigation and analysis)
- `C` - Community Track (User-focused initiatives)
- `E` - Evolution Track (System improvements)

#### Level Indicators
- `L0` - Foundation Level (Basic infrastructure)
- `L1` - Primary Level (Core features)
- `L2` - Secondary Level (Extensions)
- `L3` - Tertiary Level (Optimizations)

#### Essential Components
