# SKENAI Token System

## Overview

The SKENAI ecosystem utilizes a strategic token deployment system that integrates with GFORCE (Governance Framework for Organizational Research and Collaborative Engagement) and WILL. This document outlines the token system, XP earning mechanics, and research proposal methodology.

## Token System Architecture

### Launch Phase Tokens (Q1 2024)

1. **SHIBAK (Platform Token)**
   - Supply: 100 quadrillion
   - Purpose: Core ecosystem value
   - Features: Pattern rewards, value creation
   - Launch: Day 1

2. **SBX (Governance Token)**
   - Supply: 25 million
   - Purpose: Governance and staking
   - Features: Voting, validation
   - Launch: Day 1

3. **BSTBL (Stablecoin)**
   - Supply: Algorithmic
   - Purpose: Value stability
   - Features: Price stability, operations
   - Launch: Day 1

4. **SBV (Value Token)**
   - Purpose: Value accrual and distribution
   - Features: Value capture from operations
   - Integration: Core system mechanics

5. **EVS (Everstrike Token)**
   - Purpose: Strategic partnership token
   - Features: Cross-DAO governance, liquidity management
   - Integration: First corporate partnership token

### Token Mechanics

1. **Value Creation**
   - Pattern recognition
   - Network effects
   - System evolution
   - Growth mechanics

2. **Governance**
   - Proposal system
   - Voting mechanics
   - Validation system

## XP System Integration

### Objectives
- Increase participation in the SKENAI ecosystem
- Recognize community contributions
- Support William's development and testing

### Components
1. **XP Tracking**
   - Monitor community contributions
   - Track engagement metrics
   - Reward system integration

2. **Incentive Structure**
   - Token distribution based on XP
   - Activity-based rewards
   - Contribution recognition

### Reporting Structure
- Daily XP distribution tracking
- Weekly contribution reviews
- Monthly system effectiveness evaluation

## Research Proposal Framework

### GFORCE Standard
Research proposals follow the GFORCE standard format with specific tracks and levels:

#### Track Identifiers (GFORCE)

- `O` - Operations Track (System operations)
- `R` - Research Track (Investigation and analysis)
- `C` - Community Track (User-focused initiatives)
- `E` - Evolution Track (System improvements)

#### Level Indicators
- `L0` - Foundation Level (Basic infrastructure)
- `L1` - Primary Level (Core features)
- `L2` - Secondary Level (Extensions)
- `L3` - Tertiary Level (Optimizations)

#### Essential Components
