# Three-Stage Architecture

## Overview

WILLIAM's SKENAI system implements a three-stage sequencer architecture designed for maximum security, quality control, and efficient deployment. This architecture ensures that all content flows through appropriate validation and quality gates before reaching production.

## Stage 1: SKENAI (First Hopper)

### Purpose
- Primary collection and aggregation layer
- Handles "mashy bits" and initial intake
- First-stage validation and processing

### Key Features
- Raw content intake system
- Initial processing pipeline
- Basic validation checks
- Content categorization
- Preliminary security scanning

## Stage 2: SKENAI-Q (Staging)

### Purpose
- Intermediate processing and validation
- Quality control and content refinement
- Proposal staging and review
- Security protocol enforcement

### Key Components
- Proposal validation system (100+ proposals)
- Quality metrics assessment
- Security protocol checks
- Staging environment
- Test suite execution

### Validation Requirements
- Strict proposal format checking
- Metadata completeness verification
- Content structure validation
- Security compliance checks
- Quality metrics assessment
- Cross-reference validation

## Stage 3: SKENAI-R (Release)

### Purpose
- Final deployment stage
- Production-ready content
- Official release and distribution
- Public access management

### Key Features
- Production environment
- Release management
- Version control
- Public documentation
- Access control

## Content Flow

1. **Initial Intake (SKENAI)**
   - Raw content submission
   - Initial processing of "mashy bits"
   - Basic validation checks
   - Content categorization

2. **Quality Control (SKENAI-Q)**
   - Detailed proposal validation
   - Security protocol enforcement
   - Quality metrics assessment
   - Staging verification
   - Cross-reference checking

3. **Production Release (SKENAI-R)**
   - Final verification
   - Production deployment
   - Public distribution
   - Access management
   - Documentation updates

## Security Integration

Progressive security implementation across stages:
- Stage 1: Basic security scanning
- Stage 2: OMEGA_BLACK protocols
- Stage 3: Production security measures

## Quality Assurance

Quality checks follow WILLIAM's standards:
- Stage 1: Initial validation
- Stage 2: Comprehensive quality assessment
- Stage 3: Final verification

## Benefits

- Clear separation of concerns
- Structured content flow
- Progressive refinement pipeline
- Better quality control gates
- Organized staging process
- Alignment with CI/CD practices

This architecture maintains WILLIAM's unique requirements for content processing and governance while providing a robust framework for system evolution.
