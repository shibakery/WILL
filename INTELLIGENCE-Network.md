[Log] ← [Process] ← [Pattern]
```
- Raw pattern intake
- Initial processing
- Basic recognition
- Pattern categorization
- Preliminary intelligence

### 2. Stage 2 (SKENAI-Q)
```
[Deep] → [Quality] → [Validate]
  ↑         ↕           ↓
[Learn] ← [Assess] ← [Review]
```
- Pattern validation
- Quality assessment
- Intelligence protocols
- Technical review
- Network feedback

### 3. Stage 3 (SKENAI-R)
```
[Final] → [Deploy] → [Release]
  ↑         ↕          ↓
[Monitor] ← [Secure] ← [Track]
```
- Final verification
- Production readiness
