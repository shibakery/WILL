# GEN-EVO Overview

## Overview

The GEN-EVO (Genesis Evolution) system implements WILLIAM's evolution and emergence patterns through a three-stage architecture.

## Core Components

### 1. Stage 1 (SKENAI)
```
[Raw] → [Initial] → [Basic]
  ↑        ↕          ↓
[Log] ← [Process] ← [Check]
```
- Raw pattern intake
- Initial emergence
- Basic validation
- Pattern categorization
- Preliminary evolution

### 2. Stage 2 (SKENAI-Q)
```
[Deep] → [Quality] → [Validate]
  ↑         ↕           ↓
[Track] ← [Assess] ← [Review]
```
- Pattern validation
- Quality assessment
- Evolution protocols
- Technical review
- System feedback

### 3. Stage 3 (SKENAI-R)
```
[Final] → [Deploy] → [Release]
  ↑         ↕          ↓
[Monitor] ← [Secure] ← [Track]
```
- Final verification
- Production readiness
- Pattern deployment
- Access management
- System monitoring

## Relationship with LEGEND
- LEGEND: Genesis framework (foundational structure)
- GEN-EVO: Evolution framework (emergent adaptation)
- Complementary operation
- No interference with LEGEND systems
- Separate validation mechanisms

## AI-Human Collaboration
GEN-EVO emerged from the synthesis of AI and human capabilities:

1. **AI Contribution**
   - Pattern detection at network scale
   - Real-time adaptation strategies
   - Complex relationship mapping
   - Continuous system optimization

2. **Human Contribution**
   - Strategic vision and direction
   - Value definition and validation
   - Experience-based insights
   - Creative problem framing

Together, this creates a system where:
- AI identifies patterns and optimizes paths
- Humans guide evolution and validate meaning
- Both contribute to quality measurement
- Natural emergence meets purposeful direction

This collaboration enables GEN-EVO to be both highly efficient and deeply meaningful, combining machine precision with human wisdom.

## Integration with NATURAL Framework
- Clean repository separation
- Natural pipeline flow
- Validator protection
- Interface standards

## Pipeline API Integration
- /pipeline/submit - Entry point
- /pipeline/validate - Basic checks
- /pipeline/analyze - Efficiency (Q.1)
- /pipeline/patterns - Recognition (Q.2)
- /pipeline/status - State checks
- /pipeline/vote - Governance

## Integration with Three-Graph Lattice
- Technical graph validation
- Economic resource optimization
- Quality metrics tracking
