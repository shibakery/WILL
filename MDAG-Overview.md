# MDAG Overview

## Overview

The MDAG (Mycelial DAG) system implements WILLIAM's network topology and growth patterns through a three-stage architecture.

## Core Components

### 1. Stage 1 (SKENAI)
```
[Raw] → [Initial] → [Basic]
  ↑        ↕          ↓
[Log] ← [Process] ← [Check]
```
- Raw network intake
- Initial topology
- Basic validation
- Network categorization
- Preliminary growth

### 2. Stage 2 (SKENAI-Q)
```
[Deep] → [Quality] → [Validate]
  ↑         ↕           ↓
[Track] ← [Assess] ← [Review]
```
- Network validation
- Quality assessment
- Growth protocols
- Technical review
- System feedback

### 3. Stage 3 (SKENAI-R)
```
[Final] → [Deploy] → [Release]
  ↑         ↕          ↓
[Monitor] ← [Secure] ← [Track]
```
- Final verification
- Production readiness
- Network deployment
- Access management
- System monitoring

## Key Features

### 1. Network Structure
```yaml
Properties:
  - Decentralized mesh topology
  - Organic expansion capability
  - Self-healing connections
  - Dynamic load balancing
```

### 2. Growth Patterns
```yaml
Patterns:
  - Adaptive routing
  - Resource optimization
  - Network resilience
  - Automatic scaling
```

### 3. Integration Points
```yaml
Components:
  - Proposal system
  - Value ranking
  - Pattern recognition
  - Governance framework
```

## Benefits

1. **Scalability**
   - Handles 100k+ proposals
   - Efficient resource utilization
   - Automatic load distribution

2. **Resilience**
   - Self-healing capabilities
   - Redundant pathways
   - Fault tolerance

3. **Optimization**
   - Smart resource allocation
   - Efficient data propagation
   - Reduced network overhead

## Usage Guidelines

### 1. Integration
```typescript
interface MDAGConfig {
  networkType: string;
  scalingFactor: number;
  optimizationLevel: number;
}
```

### 2. Best Practices
- Follow organic growth patterns
- Maintain network health
- Monitor system metrics
- Regular optimization

## Security Considerations
- Access control implementation
- Network integrity verification
- Data validation protocols
- Secure communication channels

## Related Components
- GFORCE Framework
- Pattern Recognition System
- Value Ranking System
- Governance Protocol
