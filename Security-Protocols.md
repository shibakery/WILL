# Security Protocols

## Overview

Security Protocols define the comprehensive security measures and procedures implemented across the SKENAI ecosystem. These protocols ensure data protection, system integrity, and secure operations.

## Core Security Layers

### 1. OMEGA_BLACK Protocols
```
[External] → [Perimeter] → [Internal] → [Core]
     ↑           ↕            ↕           ↓
[Monitor] ← [Control] ← [Audit] ← [Protect]
```

#### Access Control
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Role management
- Session control
- Access logging

#### Data Protection
- Encryption
- Data masking
- Access control
- Integrity checks
- Backup systems

#### System Security
- Network security
- Server hardening
- Service protection
- Monitoring
- Incident response

### 2. Network Security

#### Perimeter Defense
- Firewalls
- IDS/IPS
- DDoS protection
- Access control
- Traffic monitoring

#### Internal Security
- Network segmentation
- Access controls
- Traffic monitoring
- Protocol security
- Service protection

#### Communication Security
