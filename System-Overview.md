- Basic validation
- Data categorization
- Preliminary analysis

### 2. Stage 2 (SKENAI-Q)
```
[Deep] → [Quality] → [Validate]
  ↑         ↕           ↓
[Track] ← [Assess] ← [Review]
```
- Data validation
- Quality assessment
- Processing protocols
- Technical review
- System feedback

### 3. Stage 3 (SKENAI-R)
```
[Final] → [Deploy] → [Release]
  ↑         ↕          ↓
[Monitor] ← [Secure] ← [Track]
```
- Final verification
- Production readiness
