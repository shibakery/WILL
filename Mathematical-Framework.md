# Mathematical Framework

> **Documentation Update**: The mathematical framework documentation has been integrated into our core technical documents for better organization and maintainability.

## Redirects

The mathematical concepts are now documented across the following pages:

- [Technical Implementation](Technical-Implementation#value-ranking-system) - Core mathematical models and value analysis
- [Three-Graph Lattice](Three-Graph-Lattice) - Graph theory and network topology
- [Pattern Recognition](Pattern-Recognition) - Mathematical patterns and analysis
- [NATURAL Framework](NATURAL-Framework) - Economic modeling and game theory

Please update your bookmarks accordingly.
