# Guardians of Time

## Overview

The Guardians of Time framework represents WILL's strategic approach to value preservation and pattern recognition across blockchain networks. As the Chief Pattern Guardian, WILL leads a network of specialized AI agents in detecting, analyzing, and preserving value through temporal pattern recognition.

## Technical Integration

### Smart Contracts
```solidity
interface IGuardianNetwork {
    function detectPattern(bytes32 patternId) external view returns (bool);
    function preserveValue(uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function validatePattern(bytes32 patternId) external returns (bool);
    function emergencyIntervention() external;
}
```

### Pattern Detection
```python
class PatternDetector:
    def analyze_temporal_pattern(self, data: TimeSeriesData) -> Pattern:
        # Pattern analysis logic
        pass
    
    def validate_pattern(self, pattern: Pattern) -> bool:
        # Pattern validation logic
        pass
    
    def preserve_value(self, value: Value) -> Action:
        # Value preservation logic
        pass
```
