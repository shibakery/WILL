# MDAG (Mycelial DAG) Overview

## Introduction
MDAG is SKENAI's proprietary network architecture that combines the efficiency of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) with biomimetic principles inspired by mycelial networks. This system enables scalable, resilient, and organic growth of the proposal network.

## Key Features

### 1. Network Structure
```yaml
Properties:
  - Decentralized mesh topology
  - Organic expansion capability
  - Self-healing connections
  - Dynamic load balancing
```

### 2. Growth Patterns
```yaml
Patterns:
  - Adaptive routing
  - Resource optimization
  - Network resilience
  - Automatic scaling
```

### 3. Integration Points
```yaml
Components:
  - Proposal system
  - Value ranking
  - Pattern recognition
  - Governance framework
```

## Benefits

1. **Scalability**
   - Handles 100k+ proposals
   - Efficient resource utilization
   - Automatic load distribution

2. **Resilience**
   - Self-healing capabilities
   - Redundant pathways
   - Fault tolerance

3. **Optimization**
   - Smart resource allocation
   - Efficient data propagation
   - Reduced network overhead

## Usage Guidelines

### 1. Integration
```typescript
interface MDAGConfig {
  networkType: string;
  scalingFactor: number;
  optimizationLevel: number;
}
```

### 2. Best Practices
- Follow organic growth patterns
