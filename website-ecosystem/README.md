# RENO V0 Website Strategy - Emergency Pivot

**STATUS:** CRITICAL - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED (Deadline: [Insert Deadline Date/Time])

**DATE:** April 14, 2025

## Objective

Rapidly deploy minimalist, professional, static informational websites for `thewilliam.dev` and `1of1.dev` to meet the critical launch deadline. This involves a strategic pivot away from complex live integration for V0.

## Why This Pivot?

Due to extreme time constraints and the technical complexity of integrating the full RENO backend (including a live WILLIAM API) reliably within the remaining window (<48 hours), we are prioritizing a stable, informational launch over a potentially unstable, feature-complete one.

This V0 focuses on:
1.  Establishing an online presence for key brands (`thewilliam.dev`, `1of1.dev`).
2.  Clearly communicating the core concepts and value propositions.
3.  Presenting capabilities through documentation and pre-canned examples.
4.  Articulating our core philosophy on creator IP.
5.  Managing expectations with clear V0 disclaimers.

**This is a tactical V0 launch to secure the deadline; it is a stepping stone towards the full RENO vision, not a replacement for it.**

## V0 Scope

*   **Technology:** Static HTML, CSS, minimal JS *initially*. (Next.js/v0.dev template is feasible if generation is rapid).
*   **Hosting:** Vercel.
*   **Content:** Informational text, pre-canned examples, philosophy, disclaimers.
*   **Design:** Strict adherence to minimalist, monochromatic (Black/White), Inter font guidelines.
*   **Exclusions:** No live AI integration, user accounts, databases, or complex interactivity for this V0 launch.

## Target Sites & Structure

This directory (`website-ecosystem/`) will manage the source code for the V0 static sites:

*   `thewilliam-dev/`: Source files for `thewilliam.dev` (Targeting Researchers/Developers).
*   `1of1-dev/`: Source files for `1of1.dev` (Targeting Artists/Creators, mirroring structure).
*   `(Future) shibaken-finance/`: Source files for `shibaken.finance` (Post-V0 launch).

## Next Steps

1.  **Finalize Content:** Quickly gather specific text, examples, and links needed for `thewilliam.dev` and `1of1.dev`.
2.  **Generate Site Files:** Use prompts (parameterized as outlined below) to generate the basic structure (HTML/CSS or Next.js) and content placeholders.
3.  **Populate & Refine:** Manually insert final content and refine styles.
4.  **Deploy:** Deploy each site directory individually via Vercel.
5.  **Configure DNS:** Point the respective domains to the Vercel deployments.

## Long-Term Vision

Post-launch, these V0 sites will serve as a foundation. Future iterations will involve:
*   Integrating live API calls to WILLIAM and other RENO services.
*   Adding dynamic features and user interactivity.
*   Potentially evolving the architecture based on performance and user feedback.
